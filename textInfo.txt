    48,    298, Some  say  that  the  postmodern  era  began  in 
    72,    317, architecture. The modernist sensibility in ar-
    72,    305, chitecture dominated most of the twentieth 
    48,    292, century. Its patron saint was Le Corbusier, and its 
    48,    280, prime symbol was the steel and glass skyscraper—
    48,    267, austere,  mathematical,  rational.   Postmodernist 
    48,    255, architecture,  by  contrast,  emphasized  human 
    48,    242, interactions  and  playful  imagination,  using  pas-
    48,    230, tiche  (borrowing  elements  from  other  times, 
    48,    217, traditions,  and  cultures)  to  enhance  engineering 
    48,    205, requirements.*
    63,    192, Modernist architecture stands as a visible symbol 
    48,    180, of enlightenment promise, where science and ratio-
    48,    167, nality would rule and happiness would prevail. As 
    48,    155, disillusionment with that ideal set in, migrations of 
    48,    142, people across the globe and the rise of the Internet 
    48,    130, made awareness of other cultures inescapable. Just 
    48,    117, as in ancient Greece, where increasing familiarity

   276,    330, with other cultures brought the sophists to promi-
   276,    317, nence, multiculturalism and moral relativism seem 
   276,    305, an  inescapable  consequence.*  Postmodernists  in 
   276,    292, philosophy are suspicious of claims to truth, objec-
   276,    280, tivity,  rationality,  and  universality.  They  are  du-
   276,    267, bious about the idea that natural science is an apt 
   276,    255, model for knowledge in general. They doubt that 
   276,    242, philosophy as it has been practiced in the Descartes, 
   276,    230, Hume,  Kant  tradition  can  serve  as  a  judge  of  the 
   276,    217, true and the good. And they want to leave behind 
   276,    205, (or  destroy)  all  metaphysical  pretensions  to  grasp 
   276,    192, some absolute reality beyond appearance.
   291,    180, Just  as  the  sophists  came  up  against  Socrates, 
   276,    167, so postmodernism has spawned its critics. Philo-
   276,    155, sophically speaking, we are recapitulating that old 
   276,    142, quarrel. In a recent book, Thomas Nagel (b. 1937) 
   276,    130, deplores the postmodern influence:
   288,    112, The worst of it is that subjectivism is not just an

   276,     53, Persians care for their dead (p. 63) and review the arguments

    66,    606, theoretical chic. It is used to deflect argument, 
    66,    594, or to belittle the pretensions of the arguments of 
    66,    583, others. Claims that something is without relativistic 
    66,    571, qualiﬁcation true or false, right or wrong, good or 
    66,    560, bad, risk being derided as expressions of a parochial 
    66,    548, perspective or form of life—not as a preliminary to 
    66,    537, showing that they are mistaken whereas something 
    66,    525, else is right, but as a way of showing that noth-
    66,    514, ing is right and that instead we are all expressing 
    66,    502, our personal or cultural points of view. The actual 
    66,    491, result has been a growth in the already extreme 
    66,    479, intellectual laziness of contemporary culture and 
    66,    468, the collapse of serious argument throughout the 
    66,    456, lower reaches of the humanities and social sciences, 
    66,    445, together with a refusal to take seriously, as anything 
    66,    433, other than ﬁrst-person avowals, the objective argu-
    66,    422, ments of others.1
    54,    402, Is that a just critique? To wrestle with that question, 
    54,    390, we will look at three postmodernist ideas: decon-
    54,    377, struction as formulated by Jacques Derrida, Michel 
    54,    365, Foucault’s  historical  studies  of  knowledge  and 
    54,    352, power, and the liberal ironism of Richard Rorty.2
    54,    320, Deconstruction: Jacques Derrida
    54,    305, The  idea  of  “deconstructing  texts”  has  had  a  very 
    54,    292, wide  influence.  On  the  assumption  that  language 
    54,    280, structures  all  our  thought  and  action—not  just 
    54,    267, speech  and  literature,  but  also  social  institutions 
    54,    255, and  political  structures—the  notion  of  a  “text” 
    54,    242, seems  applicable  everywhere.  If  all  our  under-
    54,    230, standings  are  structured  by  the  speciﬁc  language 
    54,    217, we  speak,  and  without  that  structuring  would  be 
    54,    205, impossible,  then  all  of  culture  is  a  kind  of  text  to 
    54,    192, be  read,  interpreted,  understood  (or  misunder-
    54,    180, stood)—and deconstructed. No one has been more 
    54,    167, influential in working out the idea of deconstruc-
    54,    155, tion than the French philosopher, Jacques Derrida 
    54,    142, (1930–2004).
    69,    130, To  understand  deconstruction,  it  will  help 
    54,    117, to get as clear as we can about what it aims to de-
    54,    105, construct. And to do that let us remind ourselves 
    54,     92, of certain themes in Heidegger. In Being and Time 
    54,     80, Heidegger adopts (or adapts) Husserl’s method of 
    54,     67, phenomenology to lay bare the essence of human 
    54,     55, existing—what  he  calls  Dasein.  To  proceed  phe-
    54,     42, nomenologically is to try to set aside the assump-
    54,     30, tions, presuppositions, and interpretations that are 
   342,    625, Deconstruction: Jacques Derrida 
   463,    624,     699
   282,    605, normally brought to experience; the aim is to let 
   282,    592, what  is  experienced—the  phenomenon—simply 
   282,    580, show itself as it is and then describe it with care by 
   282,    567, identifying its essential features. Notice that he takes 
   282,    555, for  granted  that  there  is  something—something 
   282,    542, prior to all description—in which Dasein’s Being 
   282,    530, consists. There is a truth about our being here, and 
   282,    517, that truth is revealed phenomenologically via these 
   282,    505, existential  concepts.  Human  existence  as  a  phe-
   282,    492, nomenon is laid bare—self- evident,  undeniable—a 
   282,    480, presence to be recognized and described.
   297,    467, In his later work Heidegger turns away from the 
   282,    455, claim that discovering the essence of human exis-
   282,    442, tence will lead us directly to the meaning of Being 
   282,    430, itself. But he does not turn away from the idea that 
   282,    417, the goal is still presence. If we could allow the presenc-
   282,    405, ing of beings itself to be present, that might change 
   282,    392, us, save us, rescue us from this long era of blindness 
   282,    380, to Being and deliver us into the “truth of Being.”
   297,    367, It  is  precisely  this  notion  of  presence  that 
   282,    355, Derrida has in his sights. To make it more clear, let 
   282,    342, us cite some other examples.

   309,    318, In Plato’s allegory of the cave, the prisoner turns 
   309,    306, away from mere shadows of reality and clam-
   309,    295, bers into the sunlight outside the cave, where 
   309,    283, she will eventually see the truth of things. This 
   309,    272, “seeing,” toward which Plato’s epistemology 
   309,    260, drives, is a case of the Forms being present to the 
   309,    249, knower. (See pp. 159–160.)
   297,    237, •  Aristotle argues that not everything can be 
   309,    226,  demonstrated—on pain of an inﬁnite regress—
   309,    214, so the ﬁrst principles just have to be seen to 
   309,    203, be true, seen as they present themselves to the 
   309,    191, mind. (See pp. 190–192.)
   297,    180, •  Descartes, seeking something he cannot doubt, 
   309,    168, ﬁnds it in the cogito, the “I think, therefore I 
   309,    157, am” principle. This is so clearly and distinctly 
   309,    145, present to his mind that it can play the role 
   309,    134, of a ﬁrst certainty; on this he can build. (See 
   309,    122, pp. 362–364.)
   297,    111, •  Hume may be skeptical about external things, 
   309,     99, causality, the self, and God; but impressions are 
   309,     88, just there!—present in experience. You can’t 
   309,     76, doubt the blue triangle when it presents itself in 
   309,     65, your visual ﬁeld. (See pp. 443–444.)
   297,     53, •  Kant’s transcendental critique of reason pres-
   309,     42, ents us with the constitutive principles of any
